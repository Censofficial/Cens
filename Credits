The browser isnt entirely built from scratch, its forked off of a browser in github called SLBr browser, massive credits to the owner of SLBr/SLT.
Many things are modified however including the UI, themes, features.
Again many credits to him even if hes not mentioned in the browser itself.
Go support the original browser owner: https://github.com/SLT-World/SLBr
