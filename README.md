## Privacy
Just because Cens uses Chromium (via WebView2 or CefSharp) doesn’t mean it automatically collects data. The engine provides the rendering and web compatibility, but tracking behavior comes from the browser layer and extra services on top of it. Cens makes sure no extra data tracking features are on via system level controlling.
